#TypseScript testing template

###This is a quick Dev-ops template I made for testing TS algorithms.

I liked the functionality of RunJS and the agility of testing code quickly. At the time RunJs was quite limited so I developed this enviroment for the same goal, plus all the benefits of VSCode and none of the limitations of RunJS.

Quick and more powerfull that just writing code in node.

To start developing and testing run in the command line: npm run dev
